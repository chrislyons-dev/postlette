# Postlette

A tiny desktop editor that adds Unicode emphasis for social posts.

Postlette uses Unicode characters, not rich text formatting. Platforms may render these characters differently.

## What it does

- Apply Unicode bold, italic, and bold-italic to selected text.
- Insert em dashes and separators at the cursor.
- Insert emoji from a local picker.
- Copy the result to your clipboard.
- Open and save plain text files (`.txt`).

## Quick start

1. Run the app.
2. Type or paste your post into the editor.
3. Select text and apply styling from the toolbar.
4. Use 📂 to open a `.txt` file or 💾 to save your work.
5. Click **Copy** to copy the result.

## Principles

- Offline only. No network calls.
- Compatibility-first. We only transform A–Z/a–z/0–9 as documented.
- Reversible styling with **Unstyle**.

**Note:** Use styling sparingly for readability. Heavy Unicode styling can be harder for screen readers and copy/paste.
